Deamonset:
    Deamonset makes sure 1 pod of the kind we want be running on all the nodes. Ex: kube-proxy
    kubectl get ds -n namespace => Get Deamonset
    To create a deamon set easily, do kubectl create deploy name --image --dry-run -o yaml > ds.yaml Change the Deployment to Deamonset

Static Pod:
    Static pods are not created by the masters, instead place a pod yaml in /etc/kubernetes/manifests (default place where kubelet places the pod yamls.)
    and kubelet will create that pod on that node. If not default path, the path to the manifest will be configured under --config in kubelet
    service file and look for staticPodPath

custom scheduler or multiple scheduler: 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/configure-multiple-schedulers/

    We can have multiple schedulers with our own stuff. 
    create a pod spec similar to the existing kube-scheduler
    and add the below lines in the container spec
    - --leader-elect=false => optional if you want to disable leader election
    - --scheduler-name=my-scheduler

Then create a pod which you want to be scheduled with this scheduler using the below option under pod spec.
schedulerName: my-scheduler
